### Totals by City Type
    - Total Rides:
      - Urban: 1,625
      - Suburban: 625
      - Rural: 125
    - Total Drivers:
      - Urban: 2,405
      - Suburban: 490
      - Rural: 78
    - Total Fares:
      - Urban: $39,854.38
      - Suburban: $19,356.33
      - Rural: $4,327.93
      
 ### Averages by City Type
     - Average Fare per Ride:
       - Urban: $24.53
       - Suburban: $30.97
       - Rural: $34.62
     - Average Fare per Driver
       - Urban: $16.57
       - Suburban: $39.50
       - Rural: $55.49

Urban cities generate the most revenue for PyBer as a whole. The total number of rides in urban cities is larger than the number of rides in both suburban and rural cities combined. Average fare prices, however, are significantly higher in suburban and rural areas. We can infer that this is directly in response to lower demand and longer routes due to the nature of the locations. For drivers, it is a more profitable market to drive in a suburban or rural location than an urban center.

## Summary

### Recommendations

    - PyBer can increase profitablility by increasing rides in rural areas. To do this, promotional rates could be offered to first time riders.
    - One deterent for rural and suburban riders are long wait times for pick up due to driver shortage. To combat this, PyBer can advertise high average fare per driver rates in suburban and rural areas to encourage more drivers to sign up.
    - Ride demand appears steady in urban cities, so to increase average fare per ride, a small base price could be added to all fares.
